    "  * The model with the following features--'has_attach', 'has_qm', 'has_key_word', 'author_age', and 'has_at_mention'--achieved .628 class prediction accuracy and .654 AUC, rather **insignificant** improvement over the model using all features (.611 and .647, respectively)\n",
    "* Training models on **class-balanced data** did **more** to improve performance than did any other method or combination of methods (e.g., more features, tuning)\n",
    "* Future work:\n",
    "  * Interplay between subsequent messages and replies\n",
    "  * Adding \"lurker\" activity to response\n",
    "  * Message author's reputation (e.g., \"likes\", followers)"
